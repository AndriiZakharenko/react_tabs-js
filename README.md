# React Tabs (JS)

Implemented the `Tabs` component that renders several tabs and allows the user to switch between them.

The `App` should communicate with the `Tabs` component using the following props:

- `tabs` - an array of tab objects to be rendered as `Tabs`;
- `activeTabId` - the `id` of the tab that should be active;
- `onTabSelected` - a callback executed with the `id` of a just selected tab when the user clicks on it.

The `Tabs` component should be stateless (does not have an internal state, only props).
